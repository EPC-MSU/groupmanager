= groupmanager


This plugin provide a project's tab of group management. Redmine adminisrator allow project roles of  users (not 
redmine admins) to change group's membership, view,  create or delete admin created groups or other user's groups. Permissions of operations on groups are managed from role's permissions tab in Administration.
Adding or deleteing users are allowed in scope of project. 
Works with redmine 2.2.3
In my installation users have custom fields Department and Position.
Note: You can't add user, wich is not project member. (It's an administator privelege..)
